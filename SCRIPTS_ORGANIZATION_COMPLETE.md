- ✅ All scripts in dedicated `scripts/` folder
- ✅ Clear categorization by purpose
- ✅ Easy to locate by category
- ✅ Clean root directory
- ✅ Platform-specific organization (Windows/Unix)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## 📈 Statistics

- **Total Scripts Organized**: 15 files
- **Categories Created**: 5
- **Documentation**: 1 README file
- **Platform Support**: Windows (.bat) and Unix (.sh)

### Breakdown by Category

| Category | Files | Platform |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Development | 3 | Windows + Unix |
| Production | 1 | Windows |
| Setup | 3 | Windows + Unix |
| Launchers | 8 | Windows + Unix |
| **Total** | **15** | **Multi-platform** |
