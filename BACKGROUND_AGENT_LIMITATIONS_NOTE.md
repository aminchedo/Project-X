# Background Agent Capabilities & Manual Testing Requirements

**Generated:** 2025-10-29  
**Context:** Project-X Routing QC Branch Validation  
**Branch:** cursor/validate-routing-and-feature-gate-compliance-0261

---

## Important Clarification

As a **background agent AI assistant**, I have successfully completed all **code-level validation** and **documentation tasks** for this branch. However, there are inherent limitations to what I can verify without human interaction.

---

## ✅ What I Can Do (Completed)

### Code Analysis & Validation:
- ✅ Read and analyze all source code files
- ✅ Verify provider structure and nesting order
- ✅ Confirm route configuration in `App.tsx`
- ✅ Check for RTL attributes (`dir="rtl"`) in component code
- ✅ Validate feature gate and consent gate implementation
- ✅ Trace Zustand store usage across components
- ✅ Search for potential code issues using pattern matching
- ✅ Generate compliance reports and documentation

### Documentation & Planning:
- ✅ Create comprehensive testing checklists
- ✅ Document pass/fail criteria
- ✅ Generate validation reports
- ✅ Produce merge approval documentation
- ✅ Outline post-merge rollout plans

---

## ❌ What I Cannot Do (Requires Human)

### Interactive Browser Testing:
- ❌ Open a web browser
- ❌ Click through navigation links
- ❌ Observe visual rendering of RTL text direction
- ❌ Watch WebSocket badge connection status change in real-time
- ❌ Detect header flickering or remounting visually
- ❌ Confirm smooth visual transitions between routes
- ❌ Test user interactions (clicking buttons, changing dropdowns)

### Runtime Behavior Observation:
- ❌ Monitor React component mounting/unmounting in real-time
- ❌ Observe WebSocket connection lifecycle during navigation
- ❌ Watch browser console for errors as they occur during navigation
- ❌ Detect timing-related issues (race conditions, async problems)
- ❌ Verify CSS rendering and layout behavior
- ❌ Confirm Persian/Arabic text displays correctly visually

### Development Environment Interaction:
- ❌ Start and maintain a long-running dev server for manual testing
- ❌ Interact with a running application in a browser
- ❌ Perform end-to-end (E2E) testing with user simulation
- ❌ Take screenshots or record video of application behavior

---

## What This Means for the Branch

### Code-Level Validation: ✅ COMPLETE

I have verified that the **code structure** is correct:
- Provider nesting order is correct in `App.tsx`
- All routes are under `<Route element={<AppLayout />}>`
- All required pages have `dir="rtl"` attributes
- Feature gates and consent gates are implemented
- Zustand store is used consistently
- No obvious code-level issues detected

### Runtime Validation: ⏳ REQUIRES HUMAN TESTER

The following must be verified by a **human tester with browser access**:
- Does the header actually stay visible during navigation?
- Does the WebSocket badge stay connected (not reconnect on route change)?
- Do symbol/leverage/timeframe values persist across routes?
- Does RTL actually render correctly in the browser?
- Are there any console errors during navigation?

---

## Why Manual Testing is Critical

Even though code review shows everything is correct, **runtime can still fail** due to:

1. **React Rendering Lifecycle Issues:**
   - Provider contexts might re-create on navigation due to routing edge cases
   - Components might mount/unmount in unexpected orders
   - State initialization timing issues

2. **WebSocket Connection Lifecycle:**
   - Connection might close/reopen even with correct provider structure
   - Browser-level WebSocket behavior can differ from code expectations
   - Network timing issues only visible at runtime

3. **CSS & Layout Rendering:**
   - `dir="rtl"` attribute might be overridden by CSS
   - Browser rendering might handle RTL differently than expected
   - Layout issues only visible when actually rendered

4. **Browser Console Errors:**
   - Some errors only appear during actual user interaction
   - Timing-dependent errors won't show in static code analysis
   - Provider access errors might only trigger during navigation

---

## Documents Created for Manual Testing

I have prepared comprehensive documentation to guide the manual testing process:

### 1. **MANUAL_RUNTIME_TEST_CHECKLIST.md**
- Step-by-step navigation sequence
- Pass/fail criteria for each test
- Console error monitoring guide
- Test execution record template

### 2. **MERGE_APPROVAL_STATUS.md**
- Summary of architectural approval
- What blocks merge (manual test)
- Post-merge rollout plan
- Strategic alignment confirmation

### 3. **ROUTING_QC_VALIDATION_REPORT.md** (Previously created)
- Initial code-level validation results
- Issues found and severity assessment

### 4. **ROUTING_QC_FIXES_APPLIED.md** (Previously created)
- Documented all RTL fixes
- Updated compliance score
- Verification results

---

## Recommended Workflow

### Step 1: Code Review (✅ Complete)
- All code has been analyzed and validated
- No structural issues found
- RTL fixes verified in source code
- Provider order confirmed correct

### Step 2: Manual Browser Test (⏳ Pending)
- Execute `MANUAL_RUNTIME_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`
- Navigate through all routes
- Monitor console for errors
- Verify visual rendering

### Step 3: Merge Decision
- **If manual test PASSES:** ✅ Merge to main
- **If manual test FAILS:** ❌ Fix issues and re-test

### Step 4: Post-Merge Tasks
- Add header navigation links
- Wire `/backtest` and `/intel` to FastAPI
- Standardize feature flag IDs

---

## How to Proceed

### For a Human Tester:

1. **Open the checklist:**
   ```
   MANUAL_RUNTIME_TEST_CHECKLIST.md
   ```

2. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   npm run frontend:dev
   ```

3. **Open browser to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

4. **Follow the checklist exactly:**
   - Navigate: `/` → `/scanner` → `/portfolio` → `/training` → `/backtest` → `/settings` → `/`
   - Check all four criteria at each transition
   - Record results in the checklist

5. **Report results:**
   - **PASS:** Update checklist with PASS status and merge
   - **FAIL:** Document error in checklist and investigate
