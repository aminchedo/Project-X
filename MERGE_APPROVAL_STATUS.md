---

## Approval Breakdown

### ‚úÖ 1. Architectural Approval - GRANTED

The project lead has reviewed the validation report and confirmed:

**Provider Stack Order - CORRECT:**
```
BrowserRouter ‚Üí FeatureFlagProviderWrapper ‚Üí LiveDataProvider ‚Üí Routes ‚Üí AppLayout
```

**Route Structure - COMPLIANT:**
- All 7 routes (`/`, `/scanner`, `/portfolio`, `/training`, `/backtest`, `/intel`, `/settings`) are nested under `<Route element={<AppLayout />}>`
- Global header is persistent and stable
- WSBadge, PnL, risk metrics, symbol sync all present in global header

**State Management - VERIFIED:**
- Zustand confirmed as single source of truth across the app
- No local mock state detected
- 9 files properly using `useAppStore()`

**Security & Compliance - VALIDATED:**
- High-risk pages (`/training`, `/backtest`) protected by BOTH `FeatureGate` AND `ConsentGate`
- Lower-risk pages (`/intel`, `/settings`) protected by `FeatureGate`
- Proper liability disclaimers in place

**RTL Implementation - FIXED:**
- `dir="rtl"` added to:
  - `src/pages/PortfolioEntry.tsx` line 23 ‚úÖ
  - `src/pages/ScannerEntry.tsx` line 40 ‚úÖ
  - `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` line 216 ‚úÖ
- Direction normalized across all core views

**Verdict:** The branch is **architecturally sound** and **policy-compliant**.

## ‚è≥ 2. Manual Runtime Test - PENDING EXECUTION

### Required Test Sequence:

Navigate through routes in this exact order in a single dev session (no page reloads):

1. `/`
2. `/scanner`
3. `/portfolio`
4. `/training`
5. `/backtest`
6. `/settings`
7. `/` (return)

### Pass/Fail Criteria at EVERY Transition:

#### ‚úÖ Header Persistence
- The header from `AppLayout` must stay mounted
- No flickering, disappearing, or remounting
- **If fails:** Provider structure issue ‚Üí DO NOT MERGE

#### ‚úÖ WebSocket Stability
- `WSBadge` should stay `"connected"` (or healthy state)
- Should NOT reconnect on every route change
- **If fails:** `LiveDataProvider` remounting ‚Üí DO NOT MERGE

#### ‚úÖ Shared State Continuity
- Change symbol/leverage/timeframe once in global header
- Navigate across routes
- Confirm same values reflected everywhere
- **If fails:** Local mock state leaking ‚Üí DO NOT MERGE

#### ‚úÖ RTL Rendering
- All pages should render in RTL
- No page should silently fall back to LTR
- Visual consistency across routes
- **If fails:** RTL incomplete ‚Üí DO NOT MERGE

#### ‚úÖ Console Errors
- Console must not show uncaught errors (red stack traces)
- Watch for:
  - `useFeatureFlags must be used within FeatureFlagProvider`
  - `useAppStore(...) is undefined`
  - `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'setSymbol')`
- **If any appear:** BLOCKER ‚Üí DO NOT MERGE

---

## Code Verification Completed

### Files Verified for Test Readiness:

**Provider Structure:**
- ‚úÖ `src/App.tsx` - Correct nesting order confirmed
- ‚úÖ `src/context/LiveDataContext.tsx` - WebSocket manager properly structured
- ‚úÖ `src/providers/FeatureFlagProviderWrapper.tsx` - Global feature flag provider

**Layout & State:**
- ‚úÖ `src/layout/AppLayout.tsx` - Persistent header with global state display
- ‚úÖ `src/components/WSBadge.tsx` - Reads connection status from Zustand
- ‚úÖ `src/stores/useAppStore.ts` - Single source of truth (implied from usage)

**RTL Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/PortfolioEntry.tsx` - Line 23: `<div dir="rtl">`
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/ScannerEntry.tsx` - Line 40: `<div dir="rtl">`
- ‚úÖ `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Line 216: `<div dir="rtl">`

**All critical files have been validated and are ready for runtime testing.**

---

## Minor Non-Blocking Issues

The project lead identified two minor documentation discrepancies that do NOT block merge:

### 1. PortfolioPage vs PortfolioEntry Naming
- **Issue:** Protocol references `PortfolioPage` but implementation uses `PortfolioEntry`
- **Impact:** Documentation-only mismatch
- **Requirement:** As long as `PortfolioEntry` reads from Zustand (no mock data), this is acceptable
- **Action:** Post-merge cleanup task

### 2. Feature ID for SettingsPage
- **Issue:** Uses `alerts-system` instead of `settings-dashboard`
- **Impact:** Non-blocking as long as feature key is defined in provider
- **Requirement:** Feature gate is present and functional
- **Action:** Standardize feature IDs post-merge

---

## Strategic Alignment Confirmation

The project lead confirmed this branch satisfies all strategic rules:

### ‚úÖ Single Shared Truth for Trading State (Zustand)
- Confirmed: "Zustand Store - Single source of truth maintained across 9 files"
- No regression into per-page mock state

### ‚úÖ Every Route Under Same Layout (AppLayout)
- All 7 routes nested under `<Route element={<AppLayout />}>`
- Guarantees:
  - Shared header
  - Consistent RTL
  - Live WS status visible everywhere
  - Risk/PnL visible everywhere
- Product cohesion maintained (feels like one console, not 6 separate tools)

### ‚úÖ Security / Rollout Controls
- `/training` and `/backtest` behind FeatureGate AND ConsentGate
- Enforces "no uncontrolled exposure of AI-driven or trading-impacting features" rule
- Allows landing unfinished high-risk features in main behind disabled flags
- Provides flexibility without chaos

### ‚úÖ Future Extensibility
- `FeatureFlagProviderWrapper` is global
- Can safely add new routes (`/risk`, `/alerts`, `/automation`) behind `FeatureGate`
- No risk of destabilizing app or exposing features accidentally
- Strategy can evolve while enforcing policy at routing level

---

## Post-Merge Rollout Plan

After manual test passes and merge completes:

### Step A: Merge to Main
- ‚úÖ Include all validation documents:
  - `ROUTING_QC_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
  - `ROUTING_QC_FIXES_APPLIED.md`
  - `MANUAL_RUNTIME_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`
  - `MERGE_APPROVAL_STATUS.md` (this document)
- ‚úÖ Add lightweight `docs/bolt_integration.md`:
  - Provider stack order
  - Route map
  - FeatureGate / ConsentGate policy
  - RTL requirement
  - Zustand as single source of truth

### Step B: Add Header Navigation Links
- Only AFTER merge and feature flag verification
- Header should expose navigation to all new routes
- Links to gated pages must visually indicate locked/experimental state if flag is OFF
- Do not advertise features that are disabled

### Step C: Wire `/backtest` and `/intel` to FastAPI
- `/backtest` should call real FastAPI endpoints
- `/intel` components need shared `apiConfig` / service
- Connect bolt_import/services to real backend

### Step D: Normalize Feature Flag IDs
- Align names: `training-dashboard`, `backtesting-module`, `settings-panel`, `market-intel`
- Prevents fragmentation of rollout logic
- Housekeeping task

## Contact & Questions

If manual testing reveals issues:

1. **Header remounts on navigation:**
   - Issue: `AppLayout` provider structure
   - Check: `App.tsx` routes configuration

2. **WebSocket reconnects on route change:**
   - Issue: `LiveDataProvider` lifecycle
   - Check: Provider nesting in `App.tsx`

3. **State not syncing across routes:**
   - Issue: Component using local state instead of Zustand
   - Check: `useAppStore` imports in affected component

4. **RTL not rendering:**
   - Issue: Missing `dir="rtl"` or CSS override
   - Check: Root div in affected page component

5. **Console errors about providers:**
   - Issue: Component outside provider scope
   - Check: Provider wrapping order in `App.tsx`

## Known Unknowns - Official Review Blockers

The following uncertainties require human smoke test validation and cannot be verified through static code analysis:

### WebSocket Connection Lifecycle During Navigation
**Uncertainty:** Cannot confirm whether the WebSocket connection actually stays open during route changes or if it reconnects.
**Why it matters:** If the connection drops and reconnects on navigation, traders would lose real-time data continuity and see connection status flicker.
**Manual test needed:** Yes - a human tester could navigate between routes while watching the WebSocket badge and browser network tab.

### Header Component Remounting Behavior  
**Uncertainty:** Cannot verify whether the AppLayout header actually persists without remounting during navigation.
**Why it matters:** If the header remounts, traders would see flicker and lose visual continuity of their trading context.
**Manual test needed:** Yes - a human tester could watch for visual flicker and use React DevTools to monitor component mounting.

### RTL Rendering in Actual Browser
**Uncertainty:** Can see `dir="rtl"` attributes in code but cannot verify how Persian text actually renders.
**Why it matters:** If RTL doesn't work properly, the interface would be unusable for Persian-speaking traders.
**Manual test needed:** Yes - a human tester could open the app in a browser and verify Persian text flows right-to-left correctly.

### Bolt Component Data Integration
**Uncertainty:** Cannot determine whether Bolt components (TrainingDashboard, BacktestingModule, SettingsPanel) are wired to real data or just UI mockups.
**Why it matters:** If these are just UI shells, the advanced features would be non-functional, making the product feel incomplete.
**Manual test needed:** Yes - a human tester could interact with these components to see if they perform real operations.

### Feature Flag Runtime Behavior
**Uncertainty:** Cannot verify whether feature flags actually prevent access to disabled features at runtime.
**Why it matters:** If feature gates don't work properly, users might access incomplete or dangerous features.
**Manual test needed:** Yes - a human tester could toggle feature flags and verify that pages become accessible/inaccessible accordingly.

### Console Errors During Navigation
**Uncertainty:** Cannot detect runtime JavaScript errors that might occur during actual navigation.
**Why it matters:** Console errors could indicate provider context issues, state synchronization problems, or other runtime failures.
**Manual test needed:** Yes - a human tester could monitor the browser console while navigating and report any errors.

**These are now official review blockers that require the human smoke test to resolve before merge approval.**
