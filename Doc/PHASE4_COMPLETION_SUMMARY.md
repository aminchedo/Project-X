## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Basic Scoring
```python
from scoring.engine import DynamicScoringEngine, WeightConfig
from scoring.simple_detector_adapters import create_detectors

# Initialize
detectors = create_detectors()
weights = WeightConfig()
engine = DynamicScoringEngine(detectors, weights)

# Score symbol
result = await engine.score(ohlcv, {"trend": "up"})
print(f"Direction: {result.direction}, Advice: {result.advice}")
```

### Multi-Timeframe Scanning
```python
from scoring.mtf_scanner import MultiTimeframeScanner, ScanRule

scanner = MultiTimeframeScanner(data_manager, engine, weights)
results = await scanner.scan(
    symbols=["BTC/USDT", "ETH/USDT"],
    timeframes=["15m", "1h", "4h"],
    rules=ScanRule(mode="conservative")
)
```

### API Usage
```bash
# Score a symbol
POST /api/v1/scoring/score
{
  "symbol": "BTC/USDT",
  "timeframe": "1h",
  "context": {"trend": "up"}
}

# Scan multiple symbols
GET /api/v1/scoring/scan/quick?symbols=BTC/USDT,ETH/USDT&timeframes=15m,1h
```
