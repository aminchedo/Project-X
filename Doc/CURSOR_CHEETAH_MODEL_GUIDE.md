## üí° USING CHEETAH MODEL EFFECTIVELY

### Best Practices

#### 1. Provide Context
```
Instead of: "Fix this bug"

Better: "In the ProfessionalDashboard.tsx file, the market data 
is not updating in real-time. The WebSocket connection is 
established but the updateMarketDataFromWS function isn't 
being called. Can you help debug this?"
```

#### 2. Reference Multiple Files
```
"I need to integrate the RealApiService from 
src/services/RealApiService.ts with the DataManager in 
src/services/DataManager.ts. Please update both files to 
work together seamlessly."
```

#### 3. Ask for Comprehensive Solutions
```
"Scan the entire src/components directory and identify all 
unused components. Then create a cleanup plan with specific 
file paths and import updates needed."
```

#### 4. Use for Architectural Decisions
```
"Based on the current project structure, what's the best way 
to implement real-time whale tracking? Consider the existing 
WebSocket service, DataManager, and component structure."
```

### Advanced Features

#### 1. Multi-File Editing
```
"Update the following files to add TypeScript strict mode:
1. src/services/binanceApi.ts
2. src/services/tradingEngine.ts
3. src/components/ProfessionalDashboard.tsx

Ensure all type definitions are correct and fix any errors."
```

#### 2. Codebase Analysis
```
"Analyze the entire backend/ directory and create a 
dependency graph showing which modules import from which. 
Identify any circular dependencies."
```

#### 3. Refactoring Assistance
```
"Refactor the PredictiveAnalyticsDashboard.tsx component to:
1. Split into smaller components
2. Improve performance with useMemo
3. Add proper TypeScript types
4. Implement error boundaries"
```

#### 4. Documentation Generation
```
"Generate comprehensive documentation for all API endpoints 
in the backend/api/ directory, including request/response 
formats, authentication requirements, and example usage."
```

---

## üî• POWER USER TIPS

### 1. Use @ Mentions
```
@file src/components/ProfessionalDashboard.tsx 
"Explain the component lifecycle"

@folder src/services 
"List all API services and their purposes"

@code [select code] 
"Refactor this to use hooks instead of class components"
```

### 2. Provide File Paths
```
"Update src/services/RealApiService.ts to add a new endpoint 
for fetching historical whale data"
```

### 3. Use for Code Reviews
```
"Review the changes in src/components/WhaleTracker.tsx and 
suggest improvements for:
- Performance
- Error handling
- TypeScript types
- Code organization"
```

### 4. Ask for Alternatives
```
"Show me 3 different ways to implement real-time updates 
in the RealTimeRiskMonitor component, with pros and cons 
for each approach"
```

### 5. Debug Complex Issues
```
"The WebSocket connection keeps disconnecting after 30 seconds. 
Here's the relevant code:
- src/services/EnhancedWebSocket.ts
- src/services/DataManager.ts
- src/components/ProfessionalDashboard.tsx

Help me debug this issue."
```
