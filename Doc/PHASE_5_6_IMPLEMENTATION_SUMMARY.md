---

## üìä Phase 5: Multi-Timeframe Scanner

### ‚úÖ Implemented Components

#### 1. Core Scanner Module (`/backend/scanner/mtf_scanner.py`)
- **MultiTimeframeScanner Class**: Main scanner that processes multiple symbols across multiple timeframes
- **ScanRule Dataclass**: Configurable filtering rules (aggressive/conservative modes)
- **ScanResult Dataclass**: Comprehensive scan results with timeframe breakdowns
- **CombinedScore Dataclass**: Unified scoring system across all detectors

#### 2. Key Features
- **Parallel Processing**: Scans multiple symbols simultaneously using asyncio
- **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Supports 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d timeframes with weighted scoring
- **Consensus Calculation**: Determines agreement across timeframes
- **Risk Level Assessment**: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH based on consensus strength
- **Flexible Filtering**: Aggressive and conservative scanning modes

#### 3. Scoring System
- **Immutable Formula**: 40% RSI/MACD + 25% SMC + 20% Patterns + 10% Sentiment + 5% ML
- **Timeframe Weights**: Higher timeframes get more weight (4h=30%, 1h=25%, etc.)
- **Confidence Calculation**: Based on signal strength and agreement
- **Direction Detection**: BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL with confidence levels

## üõ°Ô∏è Phase 6: Enhanced Risk Management & Position Sizing

### ‚úÖ Implemented Components

- **EnhancedRiskManager Class**: Comprehensive risk management system
- **PositionSize Dataclass**: Complete position parameters with risk metrics
- **RiskLimits Dataclass**: Configurable risk management limits

#### 2. Key Features
- **ATR-Based Position Sizing**: Uses Average True Range for dynamic position sizing
- **Structure-Based Stop Loss**: Prioritizes structure levels over ATR
- **Portfolio Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive portfolio risk analysis
- **Correlation Limits**: Prevents over-concentration in correlated assets
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Portfolio risk quantification
- **Dynamic Leverage**: Adjusts leverage based on volatility

#### 3. Risk Management Features
- **Daily Risk Limits**: Configurable daily loss limits
- **Position Limits**: Maximum number of concurrent positions
- **Drawdown Protection**: Maximum drawdown limits
- **Single Asset Limits**: Maximum exposure per asset
- **Correlation Checks**: Prevents highly correlated positions
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous risk metric updates

## üîß Configuration

### Scanner Configuration
```python
ScanRule(
    mode="conservative",           # or "aggressive"
    any_tf_threshold=0.65,        # Aggressive mode threshold
    majority_tf_threshold=0.60,   # Conservative mode threshold
    min_confidence=0.5,           # Minimum confidence required
    exclude_neutral=True          # Exclude neutral signals
)
```

### Risk Management Configuration
```python
RiskLimits(
    max_risk_per_trade=0.01,      # 1% per trade
    max_risk_per_day=0.03,        # 3% daily limit
